"""node_similarity: common neighbours and Jaccard score of two nodes.

The Jaccard score of two nodes is |neighbours(a) ∩ neighbours(b)| divided by
|neighbours(a) ∪ neighbours(b)|: 1.0 means the two nodes connect to exactly the
same others, 0.0 means they share nobody. On directed graphs direction is ignored
(neighbours = everyone connected in either direction).

Rules (the validator checks them):
- Implement the algorithm yourself: standard library, NumPy and graphkit only.
- Get graphs only from the store; never open files, print, or use the network.
- Never crash: return error("what went wrong and how to fix it") instead.
- Return every node as node_ref(g, node, ...), so it has both an id and a label.
- Keep the output under 8 KB: cap the number of listed neighbours.
- Be deterministic: same input, same output.
