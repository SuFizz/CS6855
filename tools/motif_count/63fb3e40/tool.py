"""Motif count: how often each small pattern (motif) of 3 or 4 nodes occurs in a graph.

Size 3 (the default) is the triad census: every set of three nodes is classified by the links
among them. Directed graphs have the 16 Holland-Leinhardt types of NetworkX's triadic_census,
coded by their numbers of Mutual, Asymmetric (one-way) and Null pairs plus a letter for the
shape: for example 030T is the feed-forward loop A->B->C, A->C and 030C the 3-cycle. Undirected
graphs have four types: empty, single edge, open triad (A-B-C) and triangle. The Batagelj-Mrvar
algorithm visits each connected triad exactly once, which also gives every node's counts; triads
with a single linked pair are counted by formula and the empty ones by subtraction from C(n, 3).
Runs in O(m * max_degree) time.

Size 4 counts the six connected 4-node graphlets, ignoring direction: 4_path, 4_star, 4_cycle,
tailed_triangle, diamond and 4_clique. For each node it counts the copies of every pattern
through the node, allowing extra links among the four nodes, from degrees, triangles per edge,
common neighbours and the 4-cliques. A denser 4-node pattern contains a fixed number of copies of
each sparser one, so subtracting those, densest first, gives exact counts of the patterns that
4-node sets induce. Runs in O(m * max_degree^2) time at worst.

Each count is compared with its expected value in a random graph with the same numbers of mutual,
one-way and unlinked pairs (for undirected graphs: the same density). Self-loops and weights are
ignored.
