"""motif_count: triangles, open triads and, on directed graphs, feed-forward loops and 3-cycles.

Each triangle is found once from adjacency (u < v < w, all three pairs linked); open triads then follow
from the node degrees. A feed-forward loop or cycle is three nodes joined by exactly those three
one-way edges (induced). Weights and self-loops are ignored.
