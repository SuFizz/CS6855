"""Connected components of a graph, found by breadth-first search, with their sizes.

Undirected graphs give ordinary connected components. Directed graphs give weakly
connected components (edge direction ignored); use strongly_connected_components
for components where every node reaches every other along edge directions.
Each returned component is registered as a subgraph so other tools can run on it.
