"""maximal_cliques: enumerate maximal cliques with Bron-Kerbosch (pivoting).

Rules (the validator checks them):
- Implement the algorithm yourself: standard library, NumPy and graphkit only.
- Get graphs only from the store; never open files, print, or use the network.
- Never crash: return error("what went wrong and how to fix it") instead.
- Return every node as node_ref(g, node, ...), so it has both an id and a label.
- Keep the output under 8 KB: respect top_k.
- Be deterministic: same input, same output.

    R is the clique built so far, P the candidates that could still extend it, and X the
    nodes already explored (which stops the same clique being reported twice). When P and
    X are both empty, R cannot be extended, so it is maximal.

    Pivoting is what makes this tractable: any maximal clique either excludes the pivot u
    or contains one of u's non-neighbours, so branching over P - N(u) rather than all of P
    skips work that could not produce a new clique. The pivot is chosen to maximise
    |P and N(u)|, with the node id as a tie-break so the search is reproducible.
