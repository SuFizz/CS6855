"""maximal_cliques: find the maximal cliques (groups where everyone is linked to everyone).

Bron-Kerbosch with Tomita pivoting: grow a clique R from candidates P, with X holding
nodes already tried; at each step skip the neighbours of a pivot u (the node of P | X
with the most neighbours in P), since any clique through them is found via u or a
non-neighbour of u. Worst case O(3^(n/3)), fast on sparse real graphs.
Directed graphs are treated as undirected (linked if an edge exists in either direction).
