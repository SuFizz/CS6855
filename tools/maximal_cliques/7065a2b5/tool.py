"""Maximal cliques by Bron–Kerbosch with Tomita pivoting; returns the largest cliques.

A clique is a set of nodes that are all joined to each other; it is maximal when no other
node can be added. On a directed graph, edge direction is ignored (u and v are adjacent if an
edge runs either way), as NetworkX does for find_cliques(G.to_undirected()).

Each returned clique is registered with the store as a subgraph; the largest one's id is the
result_graph_id, so other tools can run on it.
