"""bipartite_matching: maximum cardinality matching of a bipartite graph (Hopcroft-Karp).

Steps: (1) 2-colour the graph by breadth-first search; if an edge joins two nodes of the same
colour the graph is not bipartite and an error is returned. (2) Run Hopcroft-Karp: repeat
{a breadth-first search that layers the graph from the free left nodes, then depth-first
searches that find a maximal set of shortest vertex-disjoint augmenting paths} until no
augmenting path exists. Time O(E * sqrt(V)). Edge direction and weights are ignored.
