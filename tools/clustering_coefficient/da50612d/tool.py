"""Local clustering coefficient of nodes and the graph's average clustering.

Undirected graphs use c(u) = 2 T(u) / (deg(u) (deg(u) - 1)), where T(u) is the number of
triangles through u. Directed graphs use Fagiolo's directed clustering (every orientation of a
triangle counts), and the weighted variant uses the geometric mean of the normalised edge
weights, so the values match networkx.clustering / networkx.average_clustering.

Rules (the validator checks them):
- Implement the algorithm yourself: standard library, NumPy and graphkit only.
- Get graphs only from the store; never open files, print, or use the network.
- Never crash: return error("what went wrong and how to fix it") instead.
- Return every node as node_ref(g, node, ...), so it has both an id and a label.
- Keep the output under 8 KB: respect top_k.
- Be deterministic: same input, same output.
