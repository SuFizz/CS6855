"""Local clustering coefficient of a node, the graph's average clustering and its transitivity.

The local clustering of a node v with degree d >= 2 is 2*T(v) / (d*(d-1)), where T(v) is the
number of triangles through v. Nodes with degree < 2 have clustering 0. Directed graphs are
treated as undirected (edge direction is ignored); weights are ignored; self-loops are skipped.
