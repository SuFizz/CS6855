"""Closeness centrality: how close each node is to all the others, by shortest-path distance.

For a node u that reaches r other nodes at total distance D, closeness is (r / D) * (r / (n - 1)):
the inverse of the average distance, scaled by the share of the graph it reaches (the
Wasserman–Faust correction, so nodes in small components do not look central). Distances are
hop counts by breadth-first search, or edge weights by Dijkstra's algorithm. On directed graphs
the default measures distance *to* u from the other nodes ("incoming"), as NetworkX does.
