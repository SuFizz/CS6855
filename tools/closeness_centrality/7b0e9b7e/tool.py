"""Closeness centrality: how close each node is, on average, to all the other nodes.

Rules (the validator checks them):
- Implement the algorithm yourself: standard library, NumPy and graphkit only.
- Get graphs only from the store; never open files, print, or use the network.
- Never crash: return error("what went wrong and how to fix it") instead.
- Return every node as node_ref(g, node, ...), so it has both an id and a label.
- Keep the output under 8 KB: respect top_k.
- Be deterministic: same input, same output. Randomised algorithms take a `seed` parameter (default 0).

    A breadth-first search from each node gives its distance to every node it can reach.
    closeness = (r - 1) / (sum of distances) * (r - 1) / (n - 1), where r is the number of
    nodes reached (the node itself included) and n the number of nodes. The second factor
    (Wasserman and Faust) lowers the score of nodes that reach only part of a disconnected graph.
    On a directed graph the distance is measured TO the node (along incoming edges), as in NetworkX.
