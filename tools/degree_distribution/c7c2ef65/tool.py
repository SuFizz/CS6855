"""Degree distribution: how many nodes have each degree, plus the minimum, maximum and mean degree.

Highlights:
- One pass over the nodes, O(V + E); reads degrees straight from the adjacency, so even airports takes milliseconds.
- mode = total | in | out on directed graphs, so it also answers "arriving" and "departing" questions.
  total (the default) equals nx.degree_histogram, with in + out for directed graphs.
- Histogram lists only the degrees that occur, as sorted {degree, count} entries: compact (under 8 KB even for
  airports' 173 distinct degrees) and readable by an LLM without index arithmetic.
- Mean rounded to 6 decimals; the summary names the range, the mean and the most common degree (ties by
  smallest degree), so the LLM can answer from the summary alone.
- Clear errors for an unknown graph, a bad mode, in/out on an undirected graph, and unknown parameters.
