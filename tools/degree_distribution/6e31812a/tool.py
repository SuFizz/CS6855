"""Histogram of node degrees (how many nodes have each number of connections), with summary statistics.

Algorithm: one pass over the nodes to compute each node's degree from the adjacency maps,
then a count of how many nodes have each degree. Time O(V + E), memory O(V).

Degree conventions (the same as NetworkX, so results can be checked against nx.degree_histogram):
- undirected graph: degree = number of neighbours; a self-loop counts twice;
- directed graph:   mode="total" -> in-degree + out-degree (default), "in" -> in-degree, "out" -> out-degree.
