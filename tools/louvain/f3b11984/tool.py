"""louvain: modularity-based community detection (Blondel et al. 2008).

Repeat two phases until nothing improves:
  1. local moving: visit nodes in a seeded random order and move each to the neighbouring community
     with the best modularity gain, until no move helps;
  2. aggregation: collapse every community into one node (internal edges become a self-loop) and
     run phase 1 again on the smaller graph.

Modularity gain of putting node i into community C (constant factors dropped):
     w(i, C) - resolution * tot(C) * k(i) / (2m)
where w(i, C) is the edge weight from i into C, tot(C) the sum of degrees in C, k(i) the degree of i
and m the total edge weight. Directed graphs are treated as undirected: the weights of u->v and v->u
are added. Each community is registered as a subgraph so other tools can run on it.
