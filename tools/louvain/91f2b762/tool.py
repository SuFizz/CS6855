"""louvain: modularity-based community detection (Blondel et al., 2008).

Repeats two phases until modularity stops improving:
  1. local moving: visit nodes in a (seeded) random order and move each to the neighbouring
     community that increases modularity the most, until no move helps;
  2. aggregation: collapse every community into one super-node and repeat on that smaller graph.

Directed graphs are treated as undirected. Each returned community is registered in the store
as a subgraph so other tools can run on it.
