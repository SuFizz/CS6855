"""louvain: communities found by greedily maximising modularity.

Author: b2d75536. Hard tier, community category.

The Louvain method repeats two phases:

1. Local moving. Every node is put in its own community, then each node in turn
   moves to the neighbouring community that raises modularity most, until no
   single move helps.
2. Aggregation. Each community becomes one node of a smaller weighted graph,
   with the edges inside it kept as a self-loop. Phase 1 runs again on that
   graph.

Modularity compares the weight inside each community with the weight expected if
the same nodes kept their degrees but were wired at random:

    Q = sum_c [ L_c / m  -  resolution * (k_c / 2m)^2 ]

where L_c is the weight inside community c, k_c the total degree of its nodes
and m the total edge weight. Edge weights are used; a directed graph is first
made undirected by adding the weight of each direction, since modularity is
defined for undirected graphs.

The order in which nodes are visited is shuffled, so the `seed` parameter fixes
it and the tool is deterministic.
