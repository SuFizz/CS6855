"""Topological sort: an order of a directed acyclic graph's nodes, or a cycle if there is one.

Uses Kahn's algorithm, peeling the graph into stages: stage 1 holds the nodes with no incoming
edges, stage 2 the nodes whose predecessors are all in stage 1, and so on (the same grouping as
NetworkX's topological_generations). Nodes are listed by (stage, id), which is a valid topological
order and is deterministic. If some nodes are never freed, the graph has a cycle; the tool then
returns a shortest cycle through one of the blocked nodes. With `node`, only that node and its
ancestors (everything that must come before it) are ordered. Runs in O(n log n + m) time.
