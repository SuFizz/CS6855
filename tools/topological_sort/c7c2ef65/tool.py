"""Topological sort: orders the nodes of a directed acyclic graph so every edge goes from earlier to later.

Highlights:
- Kahn's algorithm with a min-heap, O((V + E) log V): ties go to the smallest node id, so the order is
  deterministic and equals nx.lexicographical_topological_sort.
- Each node also gets a level: its longest chain of predecessors, computed in the same pass. Nodes on the
  same level can be done in parallel (e.g. courses in the same semester).
- On a graph with a cycle, the error names an actual cycle (e.g. ABJ -> ACC -> ABJ), found by walking the
  nodes Kahn's algorithm could not place, instead of only saying "not a DAG".
- Undirected graphs and unknown parameters get clear errors; at most 100 nodes are listed to stay under 8 KB.
