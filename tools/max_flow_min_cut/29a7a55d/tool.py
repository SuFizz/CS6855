"""max_flow_min_cut: Edmonds–Karp maximum flow, with the cut edges.

Edge weights are capacities. The tool repeatedly finds a shortest augmenting
path from source to sink with BFS (Edmonds–Karp), pushes the path's bottleneck
through the residual network, and stops when the sink is no longer reachable.
The minimum cut is then read off the residual network, as in NetworkX: the
source side is every node that can no longer reach the sink; the cut edges are
the original edges leading out of that side. By the max-flow min-cut theorem
their total capacity equals the maximum flow.

Rules (the validator checks them):
- Implement the algorithm yourself: standard library, NumPy and graphkit only.
- Get graphs only from the store; never open files, print, or use the network.
- Never crash: return error("what went wrong and how to fix it") instead.
- Return every node as node_ref(g, node, ...), so it has both an id and a label.
- Keep the output under 8 KB: cut edges and the source side honour top_k.
- Be deterministic: same input, same output (BFS explores neighbours in a fixed order).
