# max_flow_min_cut

Author: [ANONYMOUS] (3ddaa37e)

Computes maximum flow and a minimum cut between distinct source and sink nodes using Edmonds-Karp. Use for capacity and bottleneck questions on directed or undirected graphs. Treats finite nonnegative edge weights as capacities; unweighted edges have capacity 1. Returns flow value, cut capacity and bounded previews of cut edges and both partitions. Distance weights are not physical transport capacities.

## Parameters

- `graph_id`: ID of the graph to analyse.
- `top_k`: Maximum entries in each output preview. Full scalar totals are unaffected.
- `source`: Exact source node ID. Resolve names with lookup_node.
- `sink`: Exact sink node ID. Resolve names with lookup_node.

## Output and limits

Returns the standard five-key contract. Every node has an ID and label. Floating results are rounded to six places. Lists are previews bounded by top_k and the 8 KB limit; counts and totals describe the full computation. A truncated flag reports omitted preview entries. BFS visits neighbors in ascending node ID order.

## Errors

Unknown graphs, unknown parameters, invalid top_k and unsupported inputs return helpful errors. See the description above for graph restrictions. Tools do not change their input graph, print, access files or make network requests.

## Algorithm and complexity

Run BFS in the residual network, augment by the smallest residual capacity on the path and update reverse capacities. When the sink is unreachable, residual-reachable nodes define the source side of the cut. Opposite original edges share residual entries correctly. An undirected edge provides equal capacity in either direction; self-loops do not affect transfer. No path gives zero flow. Time O(V E^2), space O(V + E).

## Checking

Run the validator and pytest from the starter root. NetworkX is used only in tests.

## Example questions

- What is the maximum flow from CS101 to CS401?
- Which edges form a minimum cut between these nodes?

## Example call and output

Input:

```json
{"graph_id": "courses", "source": "CS101", "sink": "CS401"}
```

Output fields: source, sink, max_flow, cut_capacity, cut_edges, source_side, sink_side, their full counts and truncated. All node references include id and label.
