"""k_core: the core number of every node, and the nodes of one k-core.

Author: b2d75536. Medium tier, community category.

The k-core is the largest subgraph in which every node has at least k neighbours
*inside* the subgraph. A node's core number is the largest k whose core contains
it. Both come from one peeling pass: repeatedly remove the node of smallest
current degree, and record the degree it had when it was removed.

The peeling uses a heap, so it runs in O(E log V) on an unweighted graph. On a
directed graph degree means in-degree + out-degree, the usual convention, so a
pair joined in both directions counts twice.
