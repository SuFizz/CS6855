"""shortest_path_unweighted: fewest-hop path between two nodes, found by breadth-first search.

Edge weights are ignored (every edge counts as one hop). On a directed graph the path
follows edge direction. Ties between equally short paths are broken deterministically:
neighbours are visited in ascending node-id order, so the same input always gives the same path.
