"""Personalized PageRank: how relevant every node is to one seed node.

A random walker follows an out-edge with probability alpha (chosen in proportion to edge
weight) and jumps back to the seed with probability 1 - alpha. A walker stuck at a node
with no out-edges also jumps back to the seed. The stationary distribution is found by
power iteration, which matches networkx.pagerank(G, personalization={seed: 1}, alpha=alpha).
Each iteration is O(n + m); it usually converges in well under 200 iterations.
