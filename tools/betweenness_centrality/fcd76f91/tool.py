"""betweenness_centrality: which nodes sit on the most shortest paths between others.

Uses Brandes' algorithm. For each source node:
  1. find shortest paths from it (BFS, or Dijkstra if weighted) and count how many
     shortest paths reach each node (sigma) and from which nodes (preds),
  2. walk back from the farthest node and pass "dependency" back to the predecessors.
Adding up the dependencies over all sources gives the betweenness of every node.
I scale the scores the same way NetworkX does, so results can be compared with it.
