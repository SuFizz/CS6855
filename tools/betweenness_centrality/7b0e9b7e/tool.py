"""Betweenness centrality (Brandes' algorithm): how often each node lies on shortest paths between others.

Rules (the validator checks them):
- Implement the algorithm yourself: standard library, NumPy and graphkit only.
- Get graphs only from the store; never open files, print, or use the network.
- Never crash: return error("what went wrong and how to fix it") instead.
- Return every node as node_ref(g, node, ...), so it has both an id and a label.
- Keep the output under 8 KB: respect top_k.
- Be deterministic: same input, same output. Randomised algorithms take a `seed` parameter (default 0).

    """{node: normalized betweenness}, shortest paths counted in hops (edge weights ignored).

    Brandes (2001). For each source s:
      1. Breadth-first search from s, recording for every node w its distance, sigma[w] (the number
         of shortest paths from s to w) and preds[w] (the nodes just before w on those paths).
      2. Visit the nodes from farthest to nearest and pass "dependency" back along the paths:
         delta[v] += sigma[v] / sigma[w] * (1 + delta[w]) for each predecessor v of w.
         delta[v] is the share of shortest paths from s to all other nodes that pass through v.
    Summing delta over all sources gives the betweenness. Each ordered pair (s, t) is counted once,
    so dividing by (n - 1)(n - 2) gives the normalized value, as in NetworkX.
