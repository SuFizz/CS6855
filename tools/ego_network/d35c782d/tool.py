"""Ego network of a node: the node (ego), its neighbours (alters) and the edges around them.

Rules (the validator checks them):
- Implement the algorithm yourself: standard library, NumPy and graphkit only.
- Get graphs only from the store; never open files, print, or use the network.
- Never crash: return error("what went wrong and how to fix it") instead.
- Return every node as node_ref(g, node, ...), so it has both an id and a label.
- Keep the output under 8 KB: respect top_k.
- Be deterministic: same input, same output. Randomised algorithms take a `seed` parameter (default 0).
