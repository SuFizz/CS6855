"""Girvan-Newman communities: repeatedly remove the edge with the highest betweenness until the graph splits.

Highlights:
- Same result as networkx girvan_newman at every level, including which edge is removed when several tie:
  the adjacency is built in the order NetworkX uses, and Brandes' edge betweenness is summed in the same
  order, so equal scores compare equal. Checked on karate, lesmis, projects, courses and airports subgraphs.
- 4 to 6 times faster than NetworkX: removing an edge only changes betweenness inside its own component, so
  only that component is recomputed (NetworkX recomputes the whole graph after every removal).
- Default: the level with the highest modularity. num_communities stops early at a fixed number of groups.
- Each listed community is registered as a subgraph (graph_id) for other tools; result_graph_id is the largest.
- Output always fits 8 KB: member lists are shortened first, then fewer communities are listed.
- A work limit (n * m^2) returns a helpful error for graphs too large to finish in 30 s, instead of timing out.
