## What it computes
This tool counts small 3-node subgraph patterns (motifs):

### 1. Undirected graphs
- **Triangle**: A 3-clique where all three nodes are mutually connected.
- **Open wedge**: A 2-hop path $u-v-w$ lacking an edge between $u$ and $w$.
- **Transitivity**: The ratio $3 \times \text{triangles} / \text{total\_wedges}$, where total wedges is $\sum \binom{d}{2}$.

### 2. Directed graphs (16-type triad census & derived motifs)
- Computes the standard Davis-Leinhardt 16-type triadic census using the Batagelj-Mrvar algorithm:
  `003`, `012`, `102`, `021D`, `021U`, `021C`, `111D`, `111U`, `030T`, `030C`, `201`, `120D`, `120U`, `120C`, `210`, `300`.
- **Feed-forward loop (induced)**: Strictly type `030T` (transitive triad with no extra reciprocal arcs).
- **Feed-forward loop (non-induced)**: Any configuration with a shortcut $a \to b \to c$ and $a \to c$, allowing extra edges. Calculated as:
  $$\text{FFL}_{\text{non-induced}} = \sum_{(a,b) \in E} |out(a) \cap out(b)|$$
  Identity checked against:
  $$\text{FFL}_{\text{non-induced}} = 030T + 2 \times 120U + 120C + 2 \times 120D + 3 \times 210 + 6 \times 300$$
- **Directed 3-cycle (induced)**: Strictly type `030C`.
- **Directed 3-cycle instances (non-induced)**: Cycles of length 3 where each distinct directed cycle counts separately:
  $$\text{cycle\_instances} = 030C + 120C + 210 + 2 \times 300$$
- **Node sets with directed cycle**: Sets of 3 nodes containing at least one directed cycle:
  $$\text{node\_sets} = 030C + 120C + 210 + 300$$
- **Mutual dyads**: Number of node pairs with reciprocal arcs ($u \to v$ and $v \to u$).

## Algorithm and 64-entry classifier
- **Undirected triangles**: Nodes are ordered by $(degree, id)$, edges are directed from lower to higher rank, and triangles are found by intersecting neighbor sets.
- **Directed triadic census**: Uses Batagelj-Mrvar's algorithm. For each edge $(v, u)$, it identifies the neighborhood union $s$ to count missing dyads (`012` and `102`), and encodes the 6 possible directed arcs among $(v, u, w)$ into a 6-bit mask ($2^6 = 64$ entries) to classify triples into one of the 16 types. Type `003` is determined by subtracting all active triples from $\binom{n}{3}$.

## Supported graphs
- Undirected graphs (karate, lesmis, projects).
- Directed graphs (airports, courses).
- Graphs with fewer than 3 nodes return status ok with 0 motif counts.
- Edge weights and self-loops are ignored.

## Parameters
- `graph_id` (string, required): ID of the graph to analyse.

## What result_graph_id means
This tool computes motif statistics across the whole network and does not filter or generate a new subgraph. Therefore, `result_graph_id` is always `null`.

## Time complexity
- Undirected triangle counting: $O(m \sqrt{m})$.
- Directed triad census: $O(m \cdot d_{max})$, where $d_{max}$ is the maximum degree. On the 500-node `airports` dataset, it completes in around 0.3 seconds.

## Errors
- Unknown graph ID: returns an error instructing the user to check `list_graphs`.
- Unknown parameter: returns an error listing the unrecognized parameters.
