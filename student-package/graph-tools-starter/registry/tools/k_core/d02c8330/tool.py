"""Core number of every node (Batagelj-Zaversnik bucket algorithm) and the k-core subgraph.

The k-core is the largest subgraph in which every node has at least k neighbours inside it.
A node's core number is the largest k for which it belongs to the k-core. Directed graphs are
treated as undirected (edge direction is ignored); weights are ignored; self-loops are skipped.
